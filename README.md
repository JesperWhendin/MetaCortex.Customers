# Group Project: Microservices

This repository is part of a group project where we are developing a distributed application composed of several microservices. Each team member is collectively responsible for an API Gateway, aswell as individually responsible for a specific part of the system:

- [MetaCortex.Panther](https://github.com/anders0b/MetaCortex.Panther) - Maintained by the whole group, contains the API Gateway.
- MetaCortex.Customers - Maintained by me, responsible for customer management (this repository).
- [MetaCortex.Orders](https://github.com/anders0b/MetaCortex.Orders) - Maintained by [Anders0b](https://github.com/anders0b), responsible for order management.
- [MetaCortex.Payments](https://github.com/Heimbrand/MetaCortex.Payments) - Maintained by [Heimbrand](https://github.com/Heimbrand), responsible for handling payments.
- [MetaCortex.Products](https://github.com/GabrielRai/MetaCortex.Products) - Maintained by [GabrielRai](https://github.com/GabrielRai), responsible for product information.

Together, these microservices, as well as an API-Gateway, form a complete system where each service has a clear role and responsibility.

- [MetaCortex.Full.Development](https://github.com/GabrielRai/MetaCortex.Full.Development) - **Not up to date.**
   - The complete repository where everything is integrated into one solution.
   - Used for visualization and testing purposes.
